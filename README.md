# CS50 Python Programming Exercises

Welcome to my repository for the [**CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python**](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python) course! This repository contains solutions and exercises from the course, which covers essential Python concepts and practical problem-solving skills.

## üìö Course Overview

**CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python** is a course offered by Harvard University through edX, focused on building a solid foundation in programming with Python. Throughout the course, I learned how to:

- Work with basic Python syntax and structure
- Apply control flow structures (conditionals, loops)
- Use functions and recursion
- Handle exceptions and write error-resilient code
- Work with libraries and frameworks in Python
- Understand file I/O and how to manage data
- Explore more advanced topics like decorators, generators, and object-oriented programming

## üìù Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific problem set, exercise, or project from the course.

 Final project is coming soon!!!
